  <ul>
    <li>Each account can have only one currency. For example if you have multiple currencies in your bank account, you'll need to create separate accounts for each currency.</li>
    <li>Funds can have multiple currencies, so the balance of a fund is represented by a dictionary with currencies as keys.</li>
    <li>Spending Fund is the default fund of a budget and cannot be deleted.</li>
    <li>If the expense does not have the FundId specified, it will be automatically set to Spending Fund ID.</li>
    <li>Spending Fund categories are optional.</li>
    <li>Budget operation date can be set in the future.</li>
    <li>Only budget operations with date in the future can be removed.</li>
