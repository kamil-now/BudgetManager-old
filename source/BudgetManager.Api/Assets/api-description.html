<h4>How it works:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each account can have only one currency. For example if you have multiple currencies in your bank account, you'll
    need to create separate accounts for each currency.</li>
  <li>Funds can have multiple currencies, so the balance of a fund is represented by a dictionary with currencies as
    keys.</li>
  <li>Budget operation date can be set in the future.</li>
  <li>Only budget operations with date in the future can be removed.</li>
</ul>
