<h3>How to use it:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a budget - then you'll need to create one fund marked as default</li>
  <li>Add your accounts - any form of money storage (e.g. bank accounts, investment platform, cash in
    wallet) - initial balance of those accounts will be allocated to the default fund</li>
  <li>Add more funds - money allocated from your accounts to spending categories (e.g. housing, utilities, food),
    certain type of savings or irregular expenses (e.g. backup savings, vacation, new car)</li>
  <li>Add income - choose an account where you received the money, and a fund to which you want to allocate it</li>
  <li>Transfer your funds - when you decide to change your money allocation</li>
  <li>Add new expense - choose account from which you paid and fund from which to deduct spent amount</li>
</ol>

<h4>How it works:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each account can have only one currency. For example if you have multiple currencies in your bank account, you'll
    need to create separate accounts for each currency.</li>
  <li>Funds can have multiple currencies, so the balance of a fund is represented by a dictionary with currencies as
    keys.</li>
  <li>Budget operation date can be set in the future.</li>
  <li>Only budget operations with date in the future can be removed.</li>
</ul>
